# PPEDNet: Pyramid Pooling Encoder-Decoder Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation

### Introduction
PPEDNet is an encoder-decoder netwrok based on VGG16 framework for image semantic segmentation. This work focuses on the tradeoff between
performance.

### Usage

Supported OS: 
the source code was tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Linux OS, and it should also be executable in other linux distributions.

Installation:
Please compile the modified Caffe framework caffe-segnet (It supports all all necessaty layers for PPEDNet).

Pre-trained Model:
Please download the VGG16 pre-traiend model (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo).
